Flannery O'Connor once said that a story is a "small history told in a universal light." The same could be said of poetry or art or photography&mdash;really any creative endeavor aiming to express the human experience. Artists and authors alike strive to express their message in the most effective and captivating way possible, to bring into existence a piece of power and scope. This is one of the many things we here at Unbound love about the literary arts and the reason we so strongly believe in the importance of peer editing and revision; so that we as young artists that are developing our crafts and styles can learn how to better our art, how to best convey our own histories in that "universal light." It is that community of intellectual exchange and constructive criticism that provides artists with the opportunity for creative growth and that same community that we strive to bring to the University of Oregon and Unbound.
